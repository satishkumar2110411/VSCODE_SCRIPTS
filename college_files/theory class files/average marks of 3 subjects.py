Algorithm 
    Step 1: Read marks 1,2  and 3
    Step 2: calculate total marks
    Step 3: divide total marks by 3
    
Different patterns in algorithm
    Sequential : top down approach 
    Selectional: Conditional
    Iterational: Looping several parts of the code to run it n times
    
This program comes under selectional algoritghm because
    Begin
    Step 1: Read marks1 marks2 and marks3
    Step 2: Total_marks = marks1+marks2+marks3
    Step 3: Average_marks = Total_marks/3
    Step 4: output = student_passed
    Step 5: if average_marks <65 then output = studen_failed
    Step 6: Display marks and output
    End
If to be used in iterational format then
    Begin
    Step 1: Read number_of_students
    Step 2: counter = 1
    Step 3: Read marks1 marks2 and marks3
    Step 4: Total_marks = marks1+marks2+marks3
    Step 5: Average_marks = Total_marks/3
    Step 6: output = student_passed
    Step 7: if average_marks <65 then output = studen_failed
    Step 8: Display marks and output
    Step 9: counter += 1
    Step 10: if (counter <= number_of_students) then go to Step 3
    End
